# WDF-Routing-Software

An implementation of bi-directional Dijkstra's Algorithm to calculate shortest routes across WDF school site.

## Project Description

A bi-directional Dijkstra's Algorithm: For my A-Level project, I developed a rotuing software for my school's buildings with the intention being to help new students or staff navigate their way around. Development was solely in Python, utilising both imperative and object-orientated programming paradigms for my solution. The backend graph traversal algorithm was accessed via a Graphical User Interface using Python's guizero library. I received an A\* for the end product in my assessment.

## Explanation of file system

Here is an explanation of each file in this directory

1. Accounts - This is a folder that holds a text file which contains my hash table

2. Blocks - This folder holds text files that store the route of the school's site

3. guizero - This folder is the python library for Guizero

4. Routes - This is a folder which holds any routes that the user requests to be exported from my application

5. Textures - This folders stores images, gifs and icons used by the GUI of my application

6. Prototype 1 - This is the first text-based version of my application

7. Prototype 2 - This code is the first version with a GUI

8. WDF Routing Application - This is my finished application

When logging into my application, one account you can use is:
Username: Admin1
Password: Pass123

Or you can create your own.
